# Week 13 Overview <br />


<br />


Okay, this week will focus primarily on functions.  This week will not be substantial, as it's a short week.  We will focus on creating, using, and reusing functions.  Ready?  Let's go!

For the discussion, we are going to focus on the culture around programming and how can we change that.  In my world, I don't want programming, gaming, and design to be a male-dominated experience any longer.  What I love about this class is that we have a lot of diversity, and I want to keep it that way.  My main question is, how do you think we are going to change it?  I am interested in your ideas.
