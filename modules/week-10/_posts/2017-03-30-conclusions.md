# Weekly Conclusions

Great work this week! You made things move around in the canvas. These basics provide foundational support for all games and art in which we want to create.  We looked at variables, changing variables, conditional statements like if/else statements, equality and relational operators, logical operators, and even Math functions.  That was a lot, and you all did well with it.

Next week, let's look at operators, loops, and conditionals in even greater detail and then dive into events.
