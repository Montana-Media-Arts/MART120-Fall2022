Now that you have gone through the syllabus and its technical details and policies, let's talk about how this course will look.

</div>

<div id="Text" class="tabcontent" style="display:block">
There may be some reading, and it should help you accomplish your goals. Most of the text will be written here on this website or from linked readings.
</div>

<div id="Code" class="tabcontent">
There also will many code examples. Also, there will always be download buttons for the code, so that you can play with it on your own. Remember, you are learning new languages, this means you will need to take time to explore, play, dissect, rebuild, break, etc.
</div>
<div id="Videos" class="tabcontent">
<p>There will be videos! I like to make small videos all along the way.  I will also record the live sessions for offline viewing.  I like shorter videos as they will give you a tidbit of information available for multiple times viewings if needed.  Then you can focus on the parts you need help on the most.  I think they are easier to digest, and I hope you feel the same way too.</p>
<p>This course also utilizes videos from the web on the topic of creative coding. We will draw from several resources to help augment and provide additional examples. There will be videos related to each language, and then when we get to p5, we will look at some from Daniel Shiffman's <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com" target="_blank">Coding Train</a>. These are excellent resources for learning and exploring code. So, we will use them!</p>
</div>
<div id="Pace" class="tabcontent">
<p>As mentioned a few times already, this course should be fun first and foremost, and hopefully, even if you have to put time into it, it should be something that you enjoy.</p>
<p>This week, you can familiarize yourself with a few new tools on your computer, absorb the syllabus, and schedule time in your week for classwork.</p>
<p>Next week, we will dive into writing some simple programs using Code.org and explore logical reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div id="Dates" class="tabcontent">
<p>Currently, I am planning on having weekly "modules" run from Monday to Sunday.</p>
<p>Homework will be due on Mondays at 11:59 pm, giving you the weekend to work on the projects.</p>
</div>
<div id="Homework" class="tabcontent">
<p>The course website will be a <b>Homework</b> section, and it should mirror the submission located on Moodle.  Let me know if that is not the case!</p>
<p>Feel free to share your programs via our GitHub links.  I will have a forum for that each week as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will have topics of discussion each week that will cover a variety of different subjects.</p>
</div>
<div id="Help" class="tabcontent">

<p>When you have problems in this course, you have some solutions to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem-solving.</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Google the problem.
    <ul>
    <li>
     A critical skill in creative technology is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go-to for help should always be google.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Post to the <a href="https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding1-Spring2022-Samples/issues" target="_blank">course issues forum</a>.
    <ul>
    <li>In a couple of pages, you will follow along with a short tutorial that will help you signup for GitHub, then star, and follow the "course repository." Part of this repository is an "issues forum" where you can post questions and problems you are having. Once subscribed, you receive emails of the "issues." You can then respond to them.</li>
    <li>The advantage of the GitHub issues forum is its advanced system for including formatted code. Formatted code helps with problem-solving.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the 127 Media Arts Lab -- You can access this lab 24 hours a day with your GrizCard.</li>
<li>Get help from <a href="https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding1-Spring2022/instructors/#instructor-prof-michael-cassens">Michael Cassens</a> -- use me! That's why I am here!
    <ul>
    <li>If you have a problem, please contact me.  I am in my office a lot beyond my office hours, and I can work through Skype, TeamViewer, and Zoom.  Let me know!
    </li>
    <li>One way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours. These are posted (and updated) under my <a href="https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding1-Fall2021/instructors/#office-hours">office hours section</a>. Office hours are another way via email, text, Zoom, or calls.
    </li>
    <li>If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email, text or call. (I check my email multiple times a day -- well actually it just alerts me, so I should get it unless I am out of commission or in a meeting -- sometimes they feel the same to me.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="mailto:michael.cassens@umontana.edu?subject=120%20Question">michael.cassens@umontana.edu</a></p>
        <a href="https://calendly.com/michael-cassens/120-meeting" target="_blank">Set up a Meeting</a>
    </li>
    </ul>
