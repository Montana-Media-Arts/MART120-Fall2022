# Conclusion

## Recap of the Week
This week, we examined some of the things that hold us back on students and in life.  We looked at some techniques to overcome some of the barriers that we put in front of us and how we can become stronger by changing the way we think.

We also looked at our writing code for the first time.  We focused on logical reasoning and made stuff happen, and hopefully, it was fun too.  The whole idea behind writing code shouldn't be that it's so intimidating that it's drudgery.  It should be enjoyable.  Finally, we were able to be creative by working in the Dance Party and the Artist lab and coming up with something interesting while learning to write code. 

Good job this week!

## Next Week
Next week we will look at another visual language called Scratch.
