<p>In this video, we are going to watch Randy Pausch talk about what he has overcome, and I want you to reflect upon your own life.  At first, you may think that this video is too long or tedious to watch, but it is worth it, I promise.  Please take a look and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>How did it make you feel?  Could you relate?  Take note of your thoughts on this.  Please put those thoughts into writing this week.  The reflection paper is part of your homework this week.</p>
