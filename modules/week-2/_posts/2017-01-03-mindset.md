<p>In this section, we talk about how our Mindset sets us up for success.  Too often, we get stuck in the mindset that we are only good at one thing or that we are "talented" in only certain subjects.  Have you ever thought: "I am not a Math person" or "I just can't do that" whatever "that" is?  Well, that is not uncommon.  This kind of thinking is called the "Fixed Mindset."  We must take a look at this from a different perspective.  So, I would like you to read a few short paragraphs on Mindset.</p>
