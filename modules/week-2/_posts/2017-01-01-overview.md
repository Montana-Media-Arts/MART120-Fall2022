# Week 2 Overview

## Code.org and the beginning of our new mindset

In the first week, we spent time discussing what creative coding is, looked at the graphical user interface, the command line, and introduced GitHub.com. This week, we will look at our mindset and determine what is possible and start to change our mindset.  You have done this many times in your life, and maybe you didn't realize it.  We will take inspiration from the Last Lecture by Randy Pausch, from Mindset by Carol Dweck, and discuss our learning styles. Then, we will start with Code.org and see what is possible.  Ready?  I am.
