    - If you have problems or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Cassens (me, the one writing all of this).
    - The best way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours or set up a Zoom conference call. These are posted (and updated) under my [office hours section]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours). 
    - If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email me. (I will get back to you as soon as I can.  If you don't get a message back from me, please feel free to try again (unless it's the middle of the night -- even then I sometimes respond.  I do try and sleep sometimes))
