# Weekly Conclusions

Excellent job this week!  We did some more work with Code.org learning how to create a mobile application and a small game.  Pretty cool, eh? We move to something new next week.

## Next Week

Next week, we move onto Alice, a 3D programming paradigm that lets us do even more if we want.  It still has a drag and drop interface and is meant for storytelling.  Come back and find out more next week!  As a preview, please go to alice.org and download your computer's option. It's a big download.
