# Week 4 Overview

We are going to look at influences this week in our discussions.  We will examine who/what has influenced us in the decisions we made and make even today.  We will look at the role in which mobile phones have played a part as well.

We will also go back to Code.org, but instead of looking at their more directed paths, we are going to look at App Lab and Play Lab so we can create an App right in the browser, and we can create a Game in the browser too.  They are both pretty open-ended, and even though they still use drag and drop techniques, it is a little more reading that before.  Again, we are slowly but surely moving in the direction, we want to go.  So, keep note.  Ready?  Let's go!
