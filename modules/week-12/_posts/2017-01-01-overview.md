# Week 12 Overview

This week we will review control structures, loops, variables, and then integrate some movement based on events.  The two main functions are mouse events and keyboard events.

We are going to let go of our self-portrait.  I hope you won't be sad, but let's make something new so that you have another example from which you can draw.  It will allow us to review what we did and build on it.

As for our discussion topic this week, we will talk about using/leveraging other people's work.  What are the rules here?  When/how can we use someone else's work?  When is it not okay? Do we need to create everything from scratch?
