# Homework

This week's homework introduces us to p5.js. You are going to create a self-portrait with simple shapes and then title and sign your portrait.

Need another reference? Try going to the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" target="_blank">p5.js resource page</a> on their website.

Here is a video that explains the homework, how to get things set up, and how to upload everything to GitHub.

Here is another example that shows how to get the x and y coordinates without having to calculate them or guess.  I put together a short example that should do that for you.  Go to the <a href="https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding1-Fall2022-Samples/tree/main/Mouse-Coordinates-Example" target="_blank">Mouse Coordinates Example</a> on GitHub.
