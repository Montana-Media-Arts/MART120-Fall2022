# Week 7 Overview

This week is all about style and making websites look "good."  What does that mean?  We are going to look at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how they play a role. We will look at an accessible library and how it helps us style websites.

For our discussion, we are going to talk about communication.  We will discuss how often digital communication gets misconstrued and misinterpreted.  The real question is how do we correct it when it happens and how to do we prevent it from happening in the first place.
