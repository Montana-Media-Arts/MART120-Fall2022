# HTML

<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Overview')">Overview</button>
   <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'What')">What is</button>
    
</div>

<!-- Tab content -->
<div id="Overview" class="tabcontent" style="display:block">
<!-- video -->
<p><a href="//www.youtube.com/embed/LOtPdX1t2ro" data-lity>Overview Video</a></p>

<p>I always find it useful to define what it is we are doing before we use it.</p>
</div>
<div id="What" class="tabcontent">

<p>So what is <b>HTML</b>?</p>

<p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b></p>

<p>Is it an actual programming language?  <b>No</b></p>

<p>It's a markup language, which means it can be displayed a web browser, but not compiled. It's an important distinction because that means it doesn't go down to the machine code level. If you need more convincing, I am just priming you for a later discussion.  Just think of HTML as a way to make stuff show up in the browser.  So, let's try it out.</p>

<div class="tabhtml" markdown="1">

```html
     <html>

     </html>
```

</div>

<p>Notice the <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> starts with a <b>&lt;</b> symbol and then ends with a <b>&gt;</b> symbol.  The tag, in this case, <b>html</b> goes between the two angle brackets.  Then, as you see, the tag always ends with <b>&lt;/html&gt;</b>  This is called the closing tag.</p>

<p>So, move to the next section to see the underlying structure.</p>
