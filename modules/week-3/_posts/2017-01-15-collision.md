# Collision

<p><a href="//www.youtube.com/embed/OJh5FM1zN84" data-lity>Scratch Collision Video</a></p>

All good games must have collision involved. Otherwise, it can be rather dull.  Think about Pacman, where Pacman doesn't eat the pellets, and the ghosts never kill Pacman.  It might be a little boring. We are going to learn how collision works in Scratch.

Now, you implement a collision with your two characters or add a third.  Totally up to you!  Did it work? How could you tell? Did you increase or decrease your score?  What happened when you did that?
