# Wrap Up & Conclusions

Nice job this week.  We learned more about ourselves and our Grit, and we programmed with more freedom this week.  We took a whirlwind lap around Scratch, and I hope you enjoyed it. It's fun little language. There is a lot more you can do as you experiment with it.    Feels good, yes?

## Next Week

Next week, we will go to the App Lab and Game Lab.  They have roots in Code.org, but they give you even more freedom.  It might look a little funny at first, but never fear, I will help you along the way.
