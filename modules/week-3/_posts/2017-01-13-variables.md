Alert!  Technical term.  Variables that I am sure you have seen before can seem a little daunting, vague, or both.  Variables are nothing more than names that can hold values.  We may want to create a variable so that we can keep track of our score when we collide with something or a timer variable.  Variables can serve many different purposes.

Can you create a variable?  What did you name it?  Remember to give it a good name.  Something that accurately describes the variable.  Determine if all sprites see it or just one. Does the variable show up on your screen?
